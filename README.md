# Ogallala

Ogallala is a Ruby on Rails application that manages linked local authority data. It provides the technical infrastructure for the [Rocky Mountain Names project](http://cola.jackflaps.net).

Uses elasticsearch as its index

Tested on Ruby >= 2.4.2 and Rails 5.2.2

## Installation instructions

Set up the ELK (Elasticsearch -- Logstack -- Kibana) stack on whatever OS you're running (I followed the Mac OS X instructions [here](https://logz.io/blog/elk-mac/))

Make sure you're running at least Ruby 2.4.2 and Rails 5.2.2

Clone this repo and deploy it locally with [Hivemind](https://github.com/DarthSim/hivemind)

This app doesn't really work yet so the documentation is extremely poor
